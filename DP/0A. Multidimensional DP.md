<**2D Dimensional DP**>

The **dimensions** of a DP algorithm refer to the 
**number of state variable** used to define each state


The following are common things to look out for in DP problems 
that require a **state variable**:

- An index along some input.
  : 

- A second index along some input.

- Explicit numerical constraints given in the problem.

- Variables that describe statuses in a given state.

- Some sort of data like a tuple or bitmask used to indicate things being "visited" or "used".

<**Top-down and bottom-up**>

usually a **top-down algorithm is easier to implement** 
than the equivalent bottom-up algorithm. 

With that being said, it is useful to know how to take a 
completed **top-down algorithm and convert it to bottom-up**. 

Steps
1. Start with a completed top-down implementation.
2. Initialize an array dp that is sized according to your state variables.
3. Set your base cases, same as the ones you are using in your top-down function.
4. Write a **for-loop**(s) that iterate over your state variables.
